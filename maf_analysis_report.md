# Cancer Genomics Report: Identification of Potential Therapeutic Targets

## Overview
This report summarizes the findings from the MAF (Mutation Annotation Format) data analysis and somatic interactions analysis conducted on a dataset comprising **10,129 samples** and **414 genes**. The primary focus is to identify potential therapeutic targets based on significant variant classifications and critical gene interactions.

## MAF Data Summary
The MAF analysis revealed the following significant variant classifications:
